# Corporation Favorita Store Sales Forecasting Project  

## Introduction

Welcome to the Corporation Favorita Store Sales Forecasting project! This repository is dedicated to predicting store sales for Corporation Favorita, a prominent grocery retailer in Ecuador. Through advanced time series forecasting and analytics, we aim to develop a robust model that accurately predicts unit sales across various items in different Favorita stores.

## Project Description

### Title
Enhancing Store Sales Forecasting for Corporation Favorita

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust time series forecasting model to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, providing accurate predictions for unit sales across a diverse range of items in different Favorita stores.

### Scope
The project encompasses the exploration and analysis of a comprehensive dataset, including dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, and sales figures. Supplementary files containing additional information will be utilized to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

## Methodology

To achieve the objectives, we will follow a structured approach:

1. **Data Exploration**: Thoroughly explore the provided datasets to understand the available features, their distributions, and relationships. This step will provide initial insights into the store sales data and help identify any data quality issues.

2. **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and encode categorical variables as necessary. This step may involve techniques like imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding.

3. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze the temporal aspects of the data, including trends, seasonality, and potential outliers. This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns in-store sales over time.

4. **Model Selection and Training**: Select appropriate time series forecasting models and train them using the prepared data. Consider incorporating external factors like promotions, holidays, and oil prices, if available, to enhance forecasting accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Assess the models' performance and identify the most accurate and reliable forecasting model.

6. **Model Deployment and Forecasting**: Deploy the chosen model to predict store sales for future time periods, leveraging the provided test dataset. Generate forecasts for the target period and assess the model's ability to capture the sales patterns accurately.

## Hypothesis and Analytical Questions

### Hypothesis

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in sales between promoted and non-promoted items.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Items that are promoted have significantly higher sales compared to non-promoted items.

### Analytical Questions
1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?
3. Did the earthquake impact sales?
4. Are certain groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)?
5. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
6. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?

## Project Deliverables

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering documentation.
- Trained time series forecasting models.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis.
- Final project report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.

## Conclusion

The Corporation Favorita Store Sales Forecasting Project aims to predict store sales accurately using time series forecasting techniques. By leveraging the provided datasets and following the outlined methodology, we aim to provide valuable insights to Corporation Favorita and develop a reliable forecasting model for store sales. The project will enable informed decision-making, optimize inventory management, and improve overall sales performance for the company.

The ultimate objective is to build a model that accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items.
